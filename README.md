# AdvancedBan-AG-Addon

This is a minecraft plugin addon for AdvancedBan using the AdvancedGUI system to view and manages punishments through a map GUI instead of commands.
The main purpose of this addon is to give developers an example on how to exetend GUIs from AdvnacedGUI.

Most of the layout and even some of the logic was created in the web editor without any code.
The layout file can be found in the root of this repository and will need to be placed in the AdvancedGUI layout folder when using the addon.
